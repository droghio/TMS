A Turtle Management System for Computer Craft

This system will allow for precise control of turtles in computer craft.
Linking to a web ui it is possible to quickly coordinate turtles to preform complex tasks.

When combined with existing ComputerCraft code bases this will allow in game turtles to do most anything.

Want them to construct an ingame structure, explore remote areas, or perhaps attack intruders. All of these actions can be managed through the TMS.

The system includes tracking of in game turtles, and remote access using ComputerCraft's built in http library.
